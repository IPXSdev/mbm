# Team Photos Setup

Please save the following images to these exact locations:

1. **Big Tank photo** → `/public/images/big-tank.jpg`
   - The professional photo of Big Tank in black cap and hoodie

2. **Mr. Porter photo** → `/public/images/mr-porter.png` 
   - The professional photo with crossed arms and "MR.PORTER" tattoo visible
   - Note: This is a PNG file

3. **Rockwilder photo** → `/public/images/rockwilder.jpg`
   - The photo in Yankees cap with gold chain

## How to add the images:

1. Save each image from the attachments to your computer
2. Rename them to match the exact filenames above
3. Copy them to the `/public/images/` folder in the project
4. The About page will automatically display them

## Current About page expects:
- `/images/big-tank.jpg`
- `/images/rockwilder.jpg` 
- `/images/mr-porter.jpg` (but the actual file should be .png)

Let me update the About page to use the correct .png extension for Mr. Porter.
