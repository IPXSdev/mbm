(Binary data of the new logo.png file would be placed here. Since I cannot handle binary files, I will represent it with a placeholder.)

// Placeholder for the new logo.png file.  This would be the actual binary data.
// To use this, you would replace this placeholder with the actual binary data of the logo.png file.
// For example, you might use a tool to convert the image to a base64 string and store that here,
// or you might use a file system operation to read the binary data directly.

const logoData = "REPLACE_WITH_ACTUAL_BINARY_DATA_OF_LOGO.PNG";
